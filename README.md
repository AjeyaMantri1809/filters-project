# filters-project
An extremely simple website using HTML+CSS+JS to allow users to upload a photo and try out many filters on it, including grayscale, RGB hues and my personal favourite, negative!
This website was created as the final mini-project of Duke University's "Programming Foundations with JavaScript, HTML and CSS" course on Coursera. This course is Part 1 of 5 of the "Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals Specialization" I am undertaking to prepare myself for a career in Software Development. 
Thank you for visiting my repository and I hope this website provides you a little bit of joy and laughter as you make wacky variations of your images. Cheers!
